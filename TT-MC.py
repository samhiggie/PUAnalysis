#Default Reconstruction from the analysTools.py config file

#analysisTools takes care of pre-selections, adding in extra ID's that do not come in the miniAOD
#files and embedding trigger matching (the trigger for di-Tau hadronic still should be added and checked)
#defaultRecontruction and defaultReconstructionMC are generic enough to work for any final state
#needed: muTau, tauTau, eTau, mumuTauTau, ect. However, different analyses may want to embed
#different ID's, isolations, ect. Trigger paths are input below. These plugins are typically
#found in RecoTools/plugins/
